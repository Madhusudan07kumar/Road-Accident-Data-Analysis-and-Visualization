# Road Accident Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing road accident data, completed as part of the internship selection process at the Centre for Infrastructure, Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (CiSTUP), Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.

## Project Overview

- The dashboard investigates 308,000 accident cases with the goal of uncovering insights into accident severity, contributing factors, and time-based/geographic trends.
- Key dimensions include road surface conditions, weather, location type, light conditions, and junction control.
- The project demonstrates expertise in data preparation, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and dashboard design.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Multiple charts (bar, pie, matrix, combo) for effective visualization of accident data.
- **KPI Tracking:** Includes metrics such as Accident Count, Fatal Accidents, Serious Accidents, Casualties, and Vehicle Involvement.
- **Filtering Options:** Slicers for road surface, weather, and light conditions enable granular data exploration.
- **Geographic and Time-Based Analysis:** Insights by urban/rural regions, accident frequency by day of week and quarter.
- **Junction and Speed Analysis:** Evaluation of accident rates based on junction control and speed limits.

## Key Findings

- _Rural areas_ account for 64% of accidents, highlighting urgent infrastructure needs.
- _Accident severity_ is strongly linked to weather, road surface, and junction conditions.
- _Speed_ is a critical factor: fatal accidents occur more at higher speed limits.
- _Friday_ is the most accident-prone day; Q3 and Q4 see more cases, possibly due to seasonal factors.

## Recommendations

- Improve rural infrastructure and signage.
- Install proper junction controls and improve traffic signalization.
- Enhance safety measures for roads facing adverse weather.
- Enforce speed control in high-risk areas with smart solutions.
- Deep-dive into light conditions for targeted interventions.

## Files Included

- `Road-Accident-Analysis-Report.pdf` — Summary document highlighting the approach, findings, and insights.
- `PowerBI-Dashboard.pbix` — The interactive dashboard file (**Upload separately as per submission guidelines**).
